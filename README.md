# Pong-Python
This repository contains the implementation of Pong clone developed with Python using PyGame library.
It contains two type of branches: ***main*** and ***pong-basic***.

## About pong-basic branch
This branch contains a reimplementation from my private project done with C++ of Pong and this is a version developed entirely from scratch: 
game logic and a few parts of physics 2D implemented from scratch. However, collision doesn't work properly sometimes, 
such as ball doesn't collide with a paddle well or ball goes away at begin of game.

## Library used
- PyGame
